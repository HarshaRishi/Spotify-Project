# Spotify-Project
Spotify Project is an exploratory data analysis project based on the music app, Spotify. There are two datasets namely, Spotify Features and artists used in this project. I explored the music trends like varying duration of songs over the years, correlation between different aspects like tempo, loudness, danceability etc. of a song, and more.
